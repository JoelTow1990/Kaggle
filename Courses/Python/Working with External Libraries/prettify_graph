Add the title "Results of 500 slot machine pulls"

Add the label "Balance" to the y-axis
After calling type(graph) you see that Jimmy's graph is of type matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot. Hm, that's a new one. By calling dir(graph), you find three methods that seem 
like they'll be useful: .set_title(), .set_ylim(), and .set_ylabel().

Use these methods to complete the function prettify_graph according to Jimmy's requests. We've already checked off the first request for you (setting a title).
